# PRD: Web Search Tool Integration

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enabling and testing the `WebSearchTool` within the `repl` AI assistant. The goal is to provide the agent with the ability to search the web to answer questions.

## 2. Goals

- The `repl` application should be able to use the `WebSearchTool` when a `brave_api_key` is provided in the configuration.
- The integration should be verifiable with an end-to-end test.
- The configuration process should be clearly documented for users.

## 3. Non-Goals

- This work will not involve changing the web search provider from Brave Search.

## 4. Success Metrics

- A new end-to-end test will be created that successfully calls the `WebSearchTool` through the agent and returns correct information.
- The `.env.example` file will be updated to include the `BRAVE_API_KEY`.
